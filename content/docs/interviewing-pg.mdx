There's a strange disconnect in how people think about getting jobs at great companies. They believe it's about credentials. It's not. It's about proof.

I didn't go to university. I never worked anywhere famous. Yet I ended up with offers from OpenAI, Cursor, Midjourney, ElevenLabs, and Vercel. How? By building things that made my ability obvious.

The whole process took three months and felt awful. But anyone willing to do the work can follow the same path.

## The Lie About Resumes

Here's what everyone tells you: improve your resume, apply to jobs, wait. This is bad advice for a simple reason. Resumes are proxies for ability. If you can provide direct evidence instead, the proxy becomes irrelevant.

When I applied through career pages, I got rejected everywhere. Zero interviews. My background looked weird on paper. But that didn't matter once I could show what I'd actually built.

What works better:

**Recruiters** helped a lot. One recruiter who specialized in SF startups got me most of my initial interviews. You can find similar people on LinkedIn or by asking investors to route you to their portfolio companies.

**Cold DMs to founders** had maybe a 20% success rate. The trick is making the preview interesting. Before they open your message, they should already know you're worth talking to.

**Warm intros** converted best. I'd talked to someone for fifteen minutes six months earlier. That conversation led to multiple company introductions later.

**Going viral** was the biggest unlock. I had 500 followers. I posted a demo video at 9 AM PST and asked a few friends to engage early. It got 120k views. The next day, Cursor, OpenAI, and Vercel reached out.

The common thread: every method that worked involved showing something real.

## Interviewing Is a Skill

Here's something obvious that most people miss: interviewing is different from working. You can be a great engineer and terrible at interviews. The good news is interviewing is a skill, and skills can be learned.

I'd never interviewed before this. I did seventy interviews over three months. By the end, I could predict what was coming. Most interviews follow the same patterns:

**First calls** are easy. Have a short pitch about what you've built and why it matters. Don't overthink this.

**Vibe interviews** want stories. Pick two projects you know deeply. Show demos even if they don't ask. Explain your decisions.

**Take-homes** reward presentation as much as code. Record a video explaining your choices. Show what you'd improve with more time.

**Live coding** is usually simpler than you expect. Basic React, basic logic. I did all mine on [Coderpad](https://coderpad.io/). Test it beforehand—the preview is finicky.

**System design** means planning how a feature should work. Use Excalidraw or a doc. Resources: [GreatFrontend](https://www.greatfrontend.com/), [HelloInterview](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/introduction).

Here's what Cursor and OpenAI's processes looked like:

<InterviewSchedule />

One more thing. Treat the interviewer like a coworker, not a judge. They want to know what working with you feels like. Ask questions. Discuss options. Many problems are vague on purpose.

## The Demo

Standard interviews are random. You might get a problem that fits your strengths, or you might not. But if you have a great demo, the randomness disappears.

A demo is proof. Something you built that's obviously good, clearly yours, and understandable in seconds. In several interviews, I just started showing my projects without being asked. Once they saw what I'd made, the rest became easy.

Some examples:

- [Gabriel](https://x.com/gabriel1/status/1898566138352820561) built a fast table at a previous company. He rebuilt it properly, open-sourced it, and made a tight demo. He got into OpenAI.
- [Matheus](https://www.immatheus.com/) spent ages on CSS Battles and built a [CSS-only Rubik's cube](https://cube.immatheus.com/). He got into Midjourney.
- [Erik](https://x.com/flowstated/status/1981010844386533515) saw Cursor released their API, built experiments, and posted them. He got into Cursor.
- [Mine](https://x.com/fredrikalindh/status/1986473781825605891) started as a code review tool. The diff viewer became the interesting part. I focused there.

A good demo has three properties:

**Instantly understandable.** In two seconds, someone should grasp what problem you solved and why the solution is impressive.

**Technically interesting.** Something non-obvious is happening. Complex state. Real-time constraints. Performance problems. Better if it's obscure enough that they can't fully understand how you did it.

**Verifiably yours.** Open source is ideal. They can see the commits. You're not just talking about projects—you can prove you did the work.

How do you find demo ideas? Build what your target company is already thinking about. Watch what they post on X. Talk to people who work there and ask what problems they're stuck on. Find rough edges in their product and fix them. Watch their competitors.

You don't need the perfect idea. Start building somewhere in the problem space. One part of the project will turn out to be more interesting than the rest. Focus on that part.

That's what happened to me. I was building a bigger tool called [ASI](https://asi.review/). The diff viewer was just one component. But I kept spending all my energy on it. So I extracted it, polished it, and posted it. That became the demo that mattered.

## The Negotiation

One company raised their offer by 50% when I mentioned a competing offer. Another added a $600k signing bonus to match. There's way more flexibility than people assume.

The reason is simple. These companies pay 10-20% of annual salary just to get introduced to engineers. By the time they want to hire you, they've invested a lot. They don't want to lose you over a few percent.

The key is having multiple offers at the same time. This is hard because you don't control the timing. You have two levers:

1. Stall before getting the formal offer
2. Speed up other companies by saying you have an offer and need to decide

On your first call with any company, ask about the full interview timeline. Write it down. Use this to synchronize final rounds. Most companies deliver offers on calls. Delay scheduling that call when you need time.

Here's how it worked for me: after a final interview, the recruiter wanted to schedule a follow-up. I was 99% sure it was an offer call. So I told other companies I had an offer and needed them to hurry. It worked. Five offers in ten days.

Some rules:

- Never share salary expectations before they make an offer. They'll ask multiple times. Just accept the awkwardness.
- Don't react on the call. Say it's interesting. If it's much lower than another offer, say it's "significantly below."
- Avoid accepting gifts. It creates reciprocity bias.
- Exploding offers are red flags.

## What I Actually Did

When I started, I didn't think any of this was possible. I just tried anyway.

Over three months: 30+ companies, 70+ interviews, offers from OpenAI, Cursor, Midjourney, ElevenLabs, and Vercel.

I built a ranked list of companies I wanted to work at. Then I started near the top, but not at the very top. I wanted practice first. Most introductions came through a recruiter. Some through founders I DM'd on X.

After twenty screening calls, I picked five companies for full loops. I focused on companies without take-homes so I could maximize live interview practice. For every question I flubbed, I added it to flashcards. I was also building [ASI](https://asi.review/) because I was interested in the space.

<Image src='/itw-plan.png' alt="My interview plan" width={528} height={306} className='p-4 bg-white mx-auto rotate-2' />

This part was terrible. Days of preparation followed by rejection. Lying awake replaying mistakes. I lost 3 kilos in two weeks. There were moments I wanted to take some random offer just to make it stop.

From those five companies, I got two offers. They wanted answers within a week. But I wanted to try my top-tier targets first.

I got an intro to ElevenLabs through that fifteen-minute conversation from six months earlier. While coworking at the Lovable office, I showed my projects to someone from Midjourney. He thought they were interesting and shared them on their Slack. They asked for a demo, so I built [this one](https://fredrika.dev/docs) in two days. That demo basically got me the offer.

Since it was done, I figured I should post it. Recorded a video at 9 AM PST. Asked friends to comment early. It went viral. 120k views. The next day I had messages from Cursor, OpenAI, Cognition, and Vercel. I told everyone I had an offer and would sign unless they could move fast.

The next two weeks were intense. Vercel made an offer the next day. Cognition interviews Sunday-Monday. Cursor trial Tuesday-Wednesday, coding interview Thursday, offer by Monday. Six OpenAI interviews Monday-Tuesday, offer Wednesday. I signed with Cursor on Thursday.
