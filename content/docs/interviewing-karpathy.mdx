import { InterviewSchedule } from "@/components/interview-schedule";

I've been thinking about the interview process as an optimization problem. It's fascinating how poorly most people approach it. They treat job searching like a lottery when it's really a gradient descent problem with learnable parameters.

This is my attempt to write down the algorithm. I'll be blunt: this is not comfortable to apply. But if you want to work at frontier AI companies, the expected value of following this is enormous.

## The Core Insight

**TL;DR:**
- Career pages have terrible signal-to-noise ratio. Social proof works better.
- Interviews are a skill. Skills improve with deliberate practice. n=70+ reps helps.
- Uncertainty is your enemy. A compelling demo removes most of it.
- Multiple offers create leverage. Leverage creates 3-10x salary differences.

## Getting Interviews: A Distribution Problem

I don't have a traditional background. No degree. No FAANG. When I started this process, I assumed companies like OpenAI would filter me out immediately. This assumption was wrong.

The conventional wisdom says: polish your resume, apply to job boards, hope for the best. This is basically random sampling from a very unfavorable distribution.

Let me rank the channels by actual yield:

**Career pages:** Lowest EV approach. I got exactly zero interviews this way. If you don't have brand-name credentials, the prior probability of getting through the resume screen is essentially zero.

**Recruiters:** Better. I used a recruiter who specializes in Series-A SF companies. Turn on "Open to work" on LinkedIn. Talk to investors and ask for portfolio company intros. The conversion rate is real.

**Cold outreach:** ~20% hit rate when I actually tried it. The key is front-loading the interesting signal. If the preview of your DM doesn't immediately communicate "this person built something impressive," you're deleted.

**Warm intros:** High conversion, but requires existing network. Every connection compounds. Someone I talked to once led to multiple company intros six months later.

**Going viral:** This was the unlock. I had ~500 followers. Posted a demo video before 10 AM PST. Asked friends to engage early. The algorithm picked it up. 120k impressions. Then Cursor, OpenAI, Cognition, and Vercel all reached out directly.

The math is clear: investing time in building something demo-able and making it visible has much higher expected returns than optimizing your resume.

## Interviews: Training Data Matters

Interviewing is a distinct skill from actual engineering work. This is annoying but true. The good news: it's highly learnable.

I'd never interviewed before. Over 3.5 months, I did 70+ interviews. The learning rate was steep initially, then plateaued. Most interview formats are variations on a few templates:

**Recruiter screen:** Near-zero failure rate if you can articulate a coherent narrative about your work. Prepare a 60-second pitch. Practice it until it sounds natural.

**Behavioral/vibe check:** Talk about 1-2 projects in depth. Show demos proactively even if not asked. Spend a few hours writing about each project beforehand—it crystallizes your thinking.

**Take-home projects:** Open-ended, multi-day builds. The deliverable quality matters more than perfection. Record a Loom explaining your decisions and tradeoffs. Example:

<Loom url="https://www.loom.com/share/0d2796ce9bcb42529253adf9fb2a8894" />

**Live coding:** Usually React + basic logic. All my sessions were on [Coderpad](https://coderpad.io/). Test it beforehand—the preview sometimes needs refreshing, formatting is quirky. The actual challenges were easier than I expected. They're testing for baseline competence, not genius.

**System design:** Planning how a feature or product should work. Use Excalidraw or Google Docs. Study resources: [GreatFrontend](https://www.greatfrontend.com/), [HelloInterview](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/introduction).

Here's what the interview funnels looked like for Cursor and OpenAI:

<InterviewSchedule />

Once you have an interview scheduled, make your preparation targeted. Companies usually ask about the hardest parts of their product. Reverse-engineer it:

- ElevenLabs: Understand their API. Know media streaming cold.
- Lovable: How would you build a code generation agent with live preview?

One final point: treat interviewers as collaborators, not evaluators. Ask clarifying questions. Discuss approaches out loud. Many challenges are deliberately ambiguous—they want to see how you navigate uncertainty.

## The Demo: Reducing Variance

Standard interviews have high variance. You might get a problem that happens to match your strengths, or you might not. A demo shifts the distribution in your favor.

A demo is legible proof. Something you built that is obviously impressive, clearly attributable to you, and understandable in seconds.

In several interviews, I started showing my projects without being asked. When you have a strong demo, the pressure evaporates. You're no longer convincing them you *could* build things—you're showing them you already did.

### Examples That Worked

- [**Gabriel (OpenAI)**](https://x.com/gabriel1/status/1898566138352820561): Built a high-performance table at a previous company. Rebuilt it properly, open-sourced it, made a tight demo.
- [**Matheus (Midjourney)**](https://www.immatheus.com/): Played CSS Battles obsessively. Built a [CSS-only Rubik's cube](https://cube.immatheus.com/).
- [**Erik (Cursor)**](https://x.com/flowstated/status/1981010844386533515): Saw Cursor released their API. Built experiments. Posted them.
- [**Mine**](https://x.com/fredrikalindh/status/1986473781825605891): Started with a larger project. The diff viewer component became the interesting part. I focused there, polished it, open-sourced it, posted a demo.

### Properties of Good Demos

Three requirements, all necessary:

1. **Instantly parseable.** Two seconds to understand the problem and why your solution is impressive. If it requires explanation, it's not working.

2. **Clearly non-trivial.** Under the hood, something interesting is happening: tricky UX, real-time constraints, clever data structures, performance optimization. Ideally, it's specific enough that they can't fully grok how it works.

3. **Verifiably yours.** Open source is ideal. Git history as proof of work. This eliminates the "good at talking about projects" failure mode.

### Finding Demo Ideas

The highest-yield approach: **build what your target company is already thinking about.**

How to find that:
- Monitor their X posts. What problems keep appearing?
- Talk to people who work there. Ask: "What are the hardest problems on your mind?"
- Find rough edges in their product. Build a better version.
- Watch competitors. If a competitor shipped something they haven't, that's signal.

You don't need the perfect idea upfront. Start building in the problem space. You'll discover which subproblem is disproportionately interesting.

That's exactly what happened to me. I started with a larger project ([ASI](https://asi.review/)). The diff viewer was one component. But I kept spending all my energy there. So I extracted it, polished it, and that became the demo that mattered.

## Multiple Offers: The Negotiation Game

One company increased their offer by 50% when I mentioned a competing offer. Another added a $600k signing bonus. This isn't unusual—companies often open with "this is just a starting point."

These companies pay 10-20% of annual salary just for recruiter intros. By the time they've decided to hire you, they've already invested heavily. The switching cost of losing you to a competitor is high.

The key insight: you need multiple offers **simultaneously**. Once you have an offer, you typically have 1-2 weeks to respond. Your two levers:

1. Stall the process before receiving the formal offer
2. Tell other companies you have an offer and need to accelerate

On first calls, always ask about the full interview timeline. Map it out. Use this to synchronize your final rounds across companies. Most companies deliver offers on calls. You can delay scheduling that call to buy time.

My sequence: After a final interview, the recruiter wanted to schedule a follow-up call. I was 99% certain it was an offer call. So I told other companies I had an offer and needed them to move faster. It worked. Five offers within ten days.

Once everyone has bid, let each company know roughly where they stand relative to the top offer—in cash, equity, or both—and ask what they can do.

**Basic principles:**
- Never share salary expectations before they offer. They'll ask repeatedly. Accept the awkwardness.
- Don't react emotionally on calls. Say the offer is interesting. If it's significantly below another offer, just say that.
- Avoid reciprocity bias. Don't accept gifts.
- Exploding offers or verbal-only offers are red flags.

## The Full Trajectory

I'll share my process because concrete data is more useful than abstractions.

Starting state: Never interviewed before. Non-traditional background. Skeptical this was even possible.

Over 3.5 months: 30+ companies, 70+ interviews. Final state: offers from OpenAI, Cursor, Midjourney, ElevenLabs, and Vercel.

The approach:

Built a ranked list of target companies. Started interviewing not at the very top—I wanted practice reps first. Most intros came through a recruiter. Some through cold DMs to founders.

After 20+ screening calls, I picked 5 companies for full interview loops. Prioritized companies without take-homes to maximize live interview experience. For every question that went poorly, I added it to flashcards and researched the problem space. For some companies, I built demos and sent Looms before calls.

This period was genuinely unpleasant. Days of preparation followed by rejection. Lying awake replaying mistakes. Lost 3 kilos in two weeks. There were moments I wanted to accept any offer just to end it.

From those 5 companies: 2 offers. They wanted responses within a week. But I wanted to try the top-tier companies first.

Got an intro to ElevenLabs through someone I'd talked to once six months earlier. Showed my projects to someone from Midjourney while coworking. They thought it was interesting and shared it internally. They asked for a demo, so I built [this one](https://fredrika.dev/docs) in two days. That demo basically secured the offer.

Since the demo was done, I posted it. Recorded a video, posted at 9 AM PST, asked friends to engage early. It went viral—120k impressions. Next day: messages from Cursor, OpenAI, Cognition, Vercel. I told everyone I had an offer I'd sign unless they could accelerate.

The following two weeks were the most intense of my life. Vercel offered the next day. Cognition interviews over the weekend. Cursor trial Tuesday-Wednesday, coding interview Thursday, offer by Monday. Six OpenAI interviews Monday-Tuesday, offer Wednesday. Signed with Cursor on Thursday.

**Per-Company Preparation**

- [ ] Use the product extensively. Prepare specific feedback. (Apparently many candidates show up without having used the product. Don't be that person.)
- [ ] Research your interviewer. What do they care about? What have they built? What can you connect on?
- [ ] Prepare questions you actually want answered.
    <details>
    <summary>Example questions</summary>

    - "I'm used to working independently across the stack—what does that look like here?"
    - "I want to work somewhere where people spend a lot of time in the office. Is that the culture here?"

    - "What have your best collaborations looked like?"
    - "What's top of mind for you right now?"
    - "What's been the reason people haven't worked out here?"
    - "What do you wish you'd known before you started?"
    - "If you could work on another part of the product, what would it be?"
    </details>
- [ ] Replicate the company's product. Understand how it works technically.
