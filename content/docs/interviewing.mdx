import { InterviewSchedule } from "@/components/interview-schedule";

This is the playbook I and many friends have followed to land jobs at OpenAI, Midjourney, Cursor, and similar companies without impressive backgrounds. The interviews aren't much harder than other startups. So if you're willing to put in a few months of your life, it's achievable. It will not be pleasant, but it's very likely to increase your salary by 3-10x. 

I'll walk through everything: getting interviews, nailing them, and negotiating offers. This is focused on technical roles, but much of it applies broadly. 


<ExampleCard filename="interview-playbook.md">
## The playbook

**General preparation**

- [ ]  Prepare personal pitch.
    <details>
    <summary>Example pitch</summary>

    > *"I've been coding since 16, went to a selective coding school in Europe (~1% acceptance), but left after a year to learn by building real projects. I released 9 apps and became Product Hunt Maker of the Year 2021. One project hit 1M MAU in months, so I went full-time on it - leading product, design, and frontend solo while managing 4 backend devs. Now I'm looking to work on more ambitious problems in AI."*
    </details>
- [ ]  Write about two projects you've done and record demo.
    <details>
    <summary>Example projects</summary>

## Getting interviews with a non-traditional background

I have not studied in any university. Nor have I worked in a reputable startup. Because of this, I thought getting interviews, and especially offer from OpenAI would be impossible. I was wrong.

The most common advice for getting interviews is to improve your resume and then reach out to hiring managers or applying on a career page. This is simply bad advice. I didn't get a single interview from applying directly. You're also likely to get a very different and more difficult interview process if you do this. 

Here are methods I tried ranked from worst to best:

- **Career pages:** The obvious place people start and often stop. I was rejected everywhere I applied directly. My background is non-traditional, so this wasn't very surprising.
- **Recruiters:** Most of my interviews came through a recruiter who works with top Series-A companies in SF. You could likely get similar intros by turning on "Open to work" on LinkedIn or start with [this list](https://chatgpt.com/share/6952743c-162c-800a-a96f-5e5783057889). Another path is DMing investors and asking them to route you to their strongest portfolio companies.
- **Cold mailing or DMing founders:** I had maybe a 20% success rate (although I didn't try it much). Make sure the part visible before someone opens your DM makes it clear you're interesting and looking for work. Including a demo video or a link to public work helps a lot. I think sending feedback or a demo of what you would improve in their product could work well.
- **Warm intros:** When I first visited SF earlier this year, I met a few people. They (and their friends) later introduced me to some fantastic companies. These conversations were also incredibly useful before formally interviewing - they helped me understand what the companies were thinking about, what they valued, and what working there might be like.
- **Going viral:** The biggest unlock was having a tweet go viral. You don't need a big audience - at the time I had around 500 followers. Post before 10 AM PST, record a short demo (I used [Screen Studio](https://screen.studio/)), and ask a few friends to like/retweet/reply early. If a tweet gets a few thousand impressions with good engagement, it will usually take off.


## You get good at interviewing by doing it a lot

Interviewing is very different from normal work. Luckily, you can get *much* better at it with a little bit of practice. You just need to figure out what they are like and what your weaknesses are. 

I had never interviewed before so I didn't really know what to expect. During my interviewing process I did at least 70 interviews and learned that they are mostly similar. Take home tests are fairly similar to normal work so I instead tried to get as many technical- and system design interviews as possible since.

When interviewing for technical roles these are interview formats in almost all companies:

- **Recruiter / first call:** I don't think you can really fail this. Just prepare a good personal pitch that concisely explains what you worked on and why it's cool.    
- **Vibe interview:** For all non-technical interviews you should be prepared to talk about 1-2 previous projects. It's great if you can show a quick demo (more on that later) and explain what you did and why - even if they don't ask for it. I'd recommend spending a few hours writing something similar to a blog post about the project. This will help collect your thoughts.
- **Take-home / project interview:** These are usually quite open-ended where you get a few days to build something. Don't forget to put work on the presentation / demo, explain choices you made, and what could be improved with more time. Example demo:

    {/* <Loom url="https://www.loom.com/share/df2e4c54310e4b95933449f0b9f1b9e2" /> */}
    
    <Loom url="https://www.loom.com/share/0d2796ce9bcb42529253adf9fb2a8894" />
    
- **Live coding interview:** You get a starter project and you're tasked with implementing a new feature. Often there is an image or video of the final result. All live coding interviews I did were on [Coderpad](https://coderpad.io/). It has some quirks so try it out before the interview. For example, sometimes you need to refresh the preview for changes to apply and formatting doesn't work. Almost all live coding I did was quite easy, mainly testing for basic React knowledge and logic.
- **System design:** In system design interviews, you are planning how a feature or product should work. Usually you'd use Excalidraw or Google Docs. There are example system design questions here: [GreatFrontend](https://www.greatfrontend.com/) and [HelloInterview](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/introduction).

This is what the interview processes looked like for Cursor and OpenAI:

<InterviewSchedule />

Once you have an interview booked, you can make your preparation more specific by making a pretty good guess at what the company might ask about. It's very likely to be the most technically challenging part of their product. Practice by recreating a core part of it. E.g.

- ElevenLabs: You probably want to use their API and understand media streaming.
- Lovable: how would you create a codegen agent with a dev server preview?

One more thing: treat the person interviewing you as a coworker, not an examiner. Ask questions and discuss potential solutions openly. Many challenges are deliberately vague—they're testing whether you can work in ambiguous environments and figure out what questions to ask. This mindset shift makes interviews feel less like exams and more like the actual work.

## Demos will get you offers

Companies want to know two things: can you do the work, and will you be good to work with? They try to figure this out by simulating work with interviews. But these are random challenges that might not cover what you're uniquely good at. A demo gives real proof. Something you've built that is obviously impressive, clearly yours, and easy to understand in a couple of seconds. In multiple interviews, I started demoing my past projects without them asking for it. If you get this right, the rest of the process becomes much less scary.

### **Concrete examples**

- [**Gabriel (OpenAI)**](https://x.com/gabriel1/status/1898566138352820561) built a super performant table at a previous company. He took the same problem, rebuilt it properly, open-sourced it, and made a tight demo.
- [**Matheus (Midjourney)**](https://www.immatheus.com/) played a lot of CSS Battles and built a [CSS only Rubik's cube](https://cube.immatheus.com/).
- [**Erik** (Cursor)](https://x.com/flowstated/status/1981010844386533515) saw that Cursor released their API, played with it, and posted experiments.
- [**Mine**](https://x.com/fredrikalindh/status/1986473781825605891) started as a bigger better code review idea. The most interesting part turned out to be the diff viewer. I focused on that, made it visual, open-sourced it, and posted a short demo.

### **What makes a good demo**

A good demo does three things at once:

1. **It's instantly understandable.** Someone should be able to look at a short clip or screenshot and, in two seconds, understand the problem and why your solution is cool. 
    
2. **It's clearly technically non-trivial.** Under the hood, it should be obvious that something interesting is happening: tricky UX, real-time stuff, clever data structures, complex state, performance constraints, etc. It's even better if it's so specific that they don't fully understand how it's made. 
    
3. **It's verifiably yours.** Open source is ideal. They should be able to look at the repo, see the commits, and verify that you wrote the thing. That removes a huge amount of uncertainty: you're not just someone who talks well about projects; you can point to a Git history that shows you doing the work.
    

### **How to come up with demo ideas**

The easiest path is: **build what your dream company is already thinking about**. A few ways to find that out:

- Watch what they post on X. What are they excited about? What problems keep popping up?
- Get in touch with someone who works there and ask: "What are the hardest problems you're thinking about right now?"
- Look at their product and find something that feels rough. Build a better version and show it.
- Watch their competitors. If a competitor shipped something they haven't, that's a huge hint. For a while, everyone in the code-gen space was talking about git worktrees. That would have been a perfect demo topic: explain how it works, then build something that makes it actually usable in a product. (I'm sure the Conductor founders have gotten offers)

You don't need the "perfect" idea upfront. Just start building *somewhere* close to the problem space you care about.

If you try to recreate something like Claude Code, you'll spend a lot of time thinking about agents, context, file systems, streaming, UX for errors, etc. Along the way you'll find that one part of the system is disproportionately fun or hard - and might make a great demo. 

That's what happened to me: I started with a bigger, more ambitious project ([ASI](https://asi.review/)). The diff viewer was just one part, but I noticed that's where I kept spending all my energy. So I leaned into that, polished that piece, and that became the thing I shared.

## Multiple offers can 10x your comp

One company increased their offer by 50% when I said I had a competing offer. Another added a $600k signing bonus to match another company. There's more wiggle room than you'd expect. Some companies even opened with "this is just a starting point": they *want* you to negotiate.

These companies are struggling to find talent. Most pay 10-20% of annual salary just to get introduced to good engineers by recruiters. By the time they've decided to hire you, they've already invested heavily in the process. A little strategy on your end can make a massive difference.

The key is having multiple offers *at the same time*. That last part is crucial - and tricky. You don't know how long each process will take, and once you have an offer, you typically have 1-2 weeks to respond. You have two main ways to do this:

1. Stall before getting the final offer
2. Speed up others by telling them you have an offer and need to decide asap

On your first call with any company, ask about the full interview process and write it down. Use this synchronize your final rounds. Most companies deliver offers on a call. You can delay scheduling that call to buy time.

Here's what this looked like for me: after a final interview with the founder, the recruiter wanted to schedule a follow-up call. I was 99% certain it was an offer call (people rarely hop on a call to say you sucked). So I told other companies I had an offer and needed them to speed up. It worked. I got all five offers within a week and a half.

Once everyone has made their first bid, let each company know roughly how far they are from the top offer - in cash, equity, or both - and ask what they can do.

**Negotiation basics:**

- Never share your salary expectations before they make an offer. They'll ask multiple times. Accept the awkwardness.
- Don't react on the call. Say the offer is interesting. If it's way below another offer, just note that it's "significantly below in equity/cash/both."
- Avoid reciprocity bias: don't accept gifts.
- Exploding offers or not getting offers in writing are red flags.

**Practical resources on negotiation:**

- [Levels.fyi video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyn0CKPuPlA)
- [Exponent guide](https://www.tryexponent.com/blog/tech-salary-negotiation-guide)

## TL;DR

- Do interviews to get good at them. Most interviews are 80% similar.
- Career pages are one of the worst ways to get interviews. Viral X posts is one of the best.
- You can get a 15% salary bump by negotiating well, but a 3-10x from having multiple offers.
- A good demo is the best way to remove uncertainty from the interview process.


## My experience

When I started, I didn't think any of this was possible. People around me encouraged me to try anyway. I'm glad I did.

Over 3.5 months, I interviewed with 30+ companies and did 70+ interviews. In the end, I had offers from OpenAI, Cursor, Midjourney, ElevenLabs, and Vercel. But when I started, I had no idea what to expect. I'd never interviewed before.

The best way to learn was to start doing them. This was my plan back then:

<Image src='/itw-plan.png' alt="My interview plan" width={528} height={306} className='p-4 bg-white mx-auto rotate-2' />

I built a database of companies that fit my criteria and ranked them. Then I started at the top - but not the very top. I wanted practice first. Most intros came through a recruiter. Some through founders I DMed on X.

After screening calls with 20+ companies, I picked 5 for full loops. I focused on companies without take-home tests. For questions that went poorly, I added them to flashcards. I researched unfamiliar problem spaces using Claude and my [flashcards MCP](https://x.com/fredrikalindh/status/1962905575051641306). For some companies, I built demos and sent Looms before calls. The reaction was positive, but not as effective as demos I did later over multiple weeks. During this time, I also started building [ASI](https://asi.review/) - a personal project in the codegen space I cared most about.

This process felt terrible. I spent days preparing only to get rejected. Or to find out they needed someone completely different. I'd lie in bed replaying mistakes. I lost my appetite. I dropped 3 kilos in two weeks. There were moments I wanted to accept something random and be done with it.

From those 5 companies, I got 2 offers. They wanted a response within a week. But I wanted to try my top-tier companies first.

I got an intro to ElevenLabs through someone I'd talked to once, six months earlier. While coworking at the Lovable office, I showed my projects to Matheus from Midjourney. He thought they were cool and shared them on Slack. They asked for a demo, so I built [this one](https://fredrika.dev/docs) in two days. That demo basically got me an offer.

Since it was done, I figured I might as well post about it. I recorded a video, posted at 9am PST, asked friends to comment early. It went viral with over 120k views. The next day I had messages from Cursor, OpenAI, Cognition, and Vercel. I told everyone I had an offer I'd sign unless they could move fast.

What followed was the most intense two weeks of my life. Vercel made an offer the next day. Cognition interviews Sunday-Monday. Cursor trial Tuesday-Wednesday, coding interview Thursday, offer by Monday. Then six OpenAI interviews Monday-Tuesday the following week, offer Wednesday. On Thursday, I signed with Cursor to work on the IDE.
