This is the playbook I and many friends have followed to land jobs at OpenAI, Midjourney, Cursor, and similar companies without impressive backgrounds. The interviews aren't much harder than other startups. So if you're willing to put in a few months of your life, it's achievable. It will not be pleasant, but it's very likely to increase your salary by 3-10x. 

I'll walk through everything: getting interviews, nailing them, and negotiating offers. This is focused on technical roles, but much of it applies broadly.

## My experience

When I started, I didn't think any of this was possible. I took a shot anyway, thanks to people around me who encouraged me. I'm glad I did. Looking back, I think self-doubt is probably the biggest thing holding others back.

Over the past few months, I interviewed with over 30 companies and did 70+ interviews total. I ended up with offers from OpenAI, Cursor, Midjourney, ElevenLabs, and Vercel, among others. But when I first started out, I had no idea what to expect - I'd never interviewed before. I didn't know how hard the interviews would be or how difficult it would be to even get them.

The best way to figure out what interviews were like was to start doing them. This was my plan:

<Image src='/itw-plan.png' alt="My interview plan" width={528} height={306} className='p-4 bg-white' />

I created a database of all the companies that fit my criteria and ranked them.

<Image src='/companies.png' alt="My company DB" width={508} height={285} className='p-4 bg-white' />

I started by talking to a lot of companies that were ranked highely but not in the top tier. Most through a recruiter, some through founders I DMed on X. After screening calls with over 20 companies, I picked 5 to do full interview loops with. I focused on companies without take-home tests since I was confident I'd do well on these. For questions that went poorly, I added them to a flash card app. I also spent time researching problem spaces I didn't know well (e.g. biology) using Claude and my [flashcards MCP](https://x.com/fredrikalindh/status/1962905575051641306). For some companies, I built custom demos and sent Looms before the call to show agency and understanding of their problem space. The reaction was positive, but not as effective as the demos I did later over multiple weeks. During this time, I also started building [ASI](https://asi.review/), a personal project related to the codegen space I was most interested in.

From those 5 companies, I got offers from two. They wanted a response within a week, but I wanted to try my top-tier companies first. I managed to get an intro to ElevenLabs through someone I'd talked to just once, six months earlier. While coworking at the Lovable office, I showed my projects to Matheus, who works at Midjourney. He thought they were cool and shared them with his team. They asked me to share something I had built, so I put together [this demo](https://fredrika.dev/docs) of my diff viewer in two days. That demo basically got me the job. 

Since the demo was already done, I figured I might as well post about it. I recorded a video with Screen Studio, posted it at 9am PST, and asked friends to comment early. It went viral with over 120k views. The next day, I had messages from Cursor, OpenAI, Cognition, and Vercel. I told everyone I had an offer I'd sign unless they could move fast.

What followed was the most intense two weeks of my life. Vercel made an offer the next day. Cognition interviews Sunday-Monday. Cursor trial Tuesday-Wednesday, coding interview Thursday, offer by Monday. Then six OpenAI interviews Monday-Tuesday the following week, with an offer on Wednesday.

## Getting interviews with a non-traditional background

The most common advice for getting interviews is to improve your resume and then reach out to hiring managers or applying on a career page. This is just bad advice. I didn't get a single interview from applying directly. You're also likely to get a very different and more difficult interview process if you do this. 

Here are methods I tried ranked from worst to best:

- **Career pages:** The obvious place people start and often stop. I was rejected everywhere I applied directly. My background is non-traditional, so this wasn't very surprising.
- **Recruiters:** Most of my interviews came through a recruiter who works with top Series-A companies in SF. You could likely get similar intros by turning on "Open to work" on LinkedIn or start with [this ChatGPT share list](https://chatgpt.com/share/6952743c-162c-800a-a96f-5e5783057889). Another path is DMing investors and asking them to route you to their strongest portfolio companies.
- **Cold mailing or DMing founders:** I had maybe a 20% success rate (although I didn't try it heavily). Make sure the part visible before someone opens your DM makes it clear you're interesting and looking for work. Including a demo video or a link to public work helps a lot. I think sending feedback or a demo of what you would improve in their product could work well.
- **Warm intros:** When I first visited SF earlier this year, I met a few people. They (and their friends) later introduced me to fantastic companies. These conversations were also incredibly useful before formally interviewing - they helped me understand what the companies were thinking about, what they valued, and what working there might be like.
- **Going viral:** The biggest unlock was having a tweet go viral. You don't need a big audience - at the time I had around 500 followers. Post before 10 AM PST, record a short demo (I used Screen Studio), and ask a few friends to retweet/reply early. If a tweet gets a few thousand impressions quickly, and the idea is good, it will usually take off.


## You get good at interviewing by doing it a lot

Interviewing is very different from normal work. You can get *much* better at it with practice. Most interviews are similar so you just need to figure out what they are like and what your weaknesses are. 

I had never interviewed before so I didn't really know what to expect. During my interviewing process I did at least 70 interviews and learned that they are mostly similar. Take home tests are fairly similar to normal work so I instead tried to get as many technical- and system design interviews as possible. 

I'll give examples of different interviews I got and how best to prepare. The best way to prepare for most interviews is to build many different complex things from scratch. 

When interviewing for technical roles there are the following interviews in almost all companies:

- Recruiter / first call: I don't think you can really fail this. Just prepare a good personal pitch that concisely explains what you worked on and why it's cool.
    

    
- Vibe interview: For all non-technical interviews you should be prepared to talk about 1-2 previous projects. It's great if you can show a quick demo and explain what you did and why. I'd recommend spending a few hours writing something similar to a blog post about the project. This will help collect your thoughts.
- Live coding interview: You get a starter project and you're tasked with implementing a new feature. Often there is an image or video of the final result. All live coding interviews I did were on [Coderpad](https://coderpad.io/). It has some quirks so try it out before the interview. For example, sometimes you need to refresh the preview for changes to apply and formatting doesn't work. Almost all live coding I did was quite easy, mainly testing for basic React knowledge and logic.
- System design: In system design interviews, you are planning how a feature or product should work. Usually you'd use Excalidraw or Google Docs. There are example system design questions here: [GreatFrontend](https://www.greatfrontend.com/) and [HelloInterview](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/introduction).
- Project interview: These are usually quite open-ended. Don't forget to put work on the presentation. Prepare the best way to demo, explain choices you made, and what could be improved with more time. Example demos:
    
    <Loom url="https://www.loom.com/share/df2e4c54310e4b95933449f0b9f1b9e2" />
    
    <Loom url="https://www.loom.com/share/0d2796ce9bcb42529253adf9fb2a8894" />
    

Once you have an interview booked, you can make your preparation more specific. You can make a pretty good guess at what the company might ask about. Very likely to be the most technically challenging part of their product. Practice by recreating a core part of their it. E.g.

- ElevenLabs: You probably want to use their API and understand media streaming.
- Lovable: how would you create a codegen agent with a dev server preview?

Some bigger companies probably have example exercises available online as well. 

Treat the person interviewing you as a coworker. Ask them questions and discuss potential solutions. Many challenges are deliberately vague. They check if you can work in ambiguous environments and figure out what questions are relevant to ask. 

You know better than the person interviewing you what you're good at. In multiple interviews, I started demoing my past projects without them asking for it.

- Example processes
    
    OpenAI:
    
    - 5:00 PM - 6:00 PM (Europe/Paris) - System Design/Architecture
    - 6:00 PM - 7:00 PM (Europe/Paris) - Frontend Coding
    - 7:00 PM - 7:30 PM (Europe/Paris) - Hiring Manager
    
    ----- 30m Break -----
    
    - 8:00 PM - 9:00 PM (Europe/Paris) - Refactoring
    - 9:00 PM - 9:30 PM (Europe/Paris) - Team Chat
    - 9:30 PM - 10:00 PM (Europe/Paris) - Team Chat
    
    ElevenLabs:
    
    - Live coding interview
    - Product decomp:  tests for product thinking. Can you make good decisions when left in charge? Do you understand their users? I'm not sure if there are better ways to learn this than building your own products or working in startups.
    - Call founder
    
    Cursor:
    
    - Coding interview: testing for basic logic capabilities
    - Project interview: 2 day open-ended project



## Demos will get you offers

Interview processes are designed to remove unknowns. Companies want to know two things: can you actually do the work, and will you be good to work with? Usually they do this by simulating work with interviews. These are random challenges and might not cover what you're uniquely good at. With a demo you can give real proof. Show something you've built that is obviously impressive, clearly yours, and easy to understand in a couple of seconds. If you get this right, the rest of the process becomes much less scary. 

### **Concrete examples**

- [**Gabriel (OpenAI)**](https://x.com/gabriel1/status/1898566138352820561) built a super performant table at a previous company. He took the same problem, rebuilt it properly, open-sourced it, and made a tight demo.
- [**Matheus**](https://www.immatheus.com/) (Midjourney) played a lot of CSS Battles and built a [CSS only Rubik's cube](https://cube.immatheus.com/).
- [**Erik** (Cursor)](https://x.com/flowstated/status/1981010844386533515) saw that Cursor released their API, played with it, and posted experiments.
- [**Mine**](https://x.com/fredrikalindh/status/1986473781825605891) started as a bigger better code review idea. The most interesting part turned out to be the diff viewer. I focused on that, made it visual, open-sourced it, and posted a short demo.

### **What makes a good demo**

A good demo does three things at once:

1. **It's instantly understandable.**
    
    Someone should be able to look at a short clip or screenshot and, in two seconds, understand the problem and why your solution is cool. 
    
2. **It's clearly technically non-trivial.**
    
    Under the hood, it should be obvious that something interesting is happening: tricky UX, real-time stuff, clever data structures, complex state, performance constraints, etc. It's even better if it's so specific that they don't fully understand how it's made. 
    
3. **It's verifiably yours.**
    
    Open source is ideal. They should be able to look at the repo, see the commits, and verify that you wrote the thing. That removes a huge amount of uncertainty: you're not just someone who talks well about projects; you can point to a Git history that shows you doing the work.
    

### **How to come up with demo ideas**

The easiest path is: **build what your dream company is already thinking about**. A few ways to find that out:

- Watch what they post on X. What are they excited about? What problems keep popping up?
- Get in touch with someone who works there and ask: "What are the hardest problems you're thinking about right now?"
- Look at their product and find something that feels rough. Build a better version and show it.
- Watch their competitors. If a competitor shipped something they haven't, that's a huge hint. For a while, everyone in the code-gen space was talking about git worktrees. That would have been a perfect demo topic: explain how it works, then build something that makes it actually usable in a product. (I'm sure the Conductor founders have gotten offers)

You don't need the "perfect" idea upfront. Just start building *somewhere* close to the problem space you care about.

If you try to recreate something like Claude Code, you'll spend a lot of time thinking about agents, context, file systems, streaming, UX for errors, etc. Along the way you'll find that one part of the system is disproportionately fun or hard - and might make a great demo. 

That's what happened to me: I started with a bigger, more ambitious project ([ASI](https://asi.review/)). The diff viewer was just one part, but I noticed that's where I kept spending all my energy. So I leaned into that, polished that piece, and that became the thing I shared.

## Multiple offers can 10x your comp

I had one company increase their offer by 50% by just saying that I had a competing offer. Another added a 600k signing bonus to match another company. There is a lot of wiggle room for almost all offers. Some companies even started their offer with "this is just a starting point" – they are expecting you to negotiate. These companies are struggling to find great talent. Most companies pay 10-20% of the yearly salary just for recruiters to introduce them to good engineers. If they've gone through the entire process and decided they want to hire you they've already invested a bunch of time. The small effort to be strategic can make a huge difference. 

The most important is to have multiple offers *at the same time*. The last part is vital and hard. You don't know how long each process will be and once you have an offer you will usually need to reply within 1-2 weeks max. You have two main ways to do this: 

1. Stall before getting the final offer
2. Speed up others by telling them you have an offer and you need to decide asap

You should always ask what the full process is in the first call and write that down. Then you can stall in the middle so you try to get to the final interviews at the same time. Most companies will give you the offer on a call. You can also delay this call and use this knowledge to speed up others. For example, I had a final interview with the founder and next the recruiter wanted to jump on a call. I was 99% certain that call was an offer call (it was - people rarely jump on a call to say you sucked) so I told the other companies I had an offer and that they would need to speed up otherwise I would sign. With this method I got all 5 offers within 1.5 weeks. 

Given that you don't say what the other offers are, you will get varying total compensation in the different offers. Once everyone has given their first bid you can let them know approximately how far they are in cash vs equity from top offer and see what they can do. 

Negotiation basics:

- Never say your salary expectation before their offer. They might ask you multiple times, just accept the awkwardness.
- Exploding offers or not getting details in writing are red flags
- Don't accept/react on the call. Just say the offer is interesting, unless it's way below an existing offer. Then just say "this is significantly below another offer in equity/cash/both".
- Avoid reciprocity bias: don't accept gifts

Practical resources on negotiation:

- [Levels.fyi video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyn0CKPuPlA)
- [Exponent blog](https://www.tryexponent.com/blog/tech-salary-negotiation-guide)

## TL;DR

- Practice interviewing to get good: "You must learn by *doing* the thing you want to be good at" (Ultralearning). Most interviews are 80% similar.
- Career pages are one of the worst ways to get interviews. Viral X posts is one of the best.
- You can get a 15% salary bump by negotiating well, but a 3-10x from having multiple offers.
